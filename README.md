# Mentorship 3 (Functional Programming Baby Steps through Haskell)

This mentorship is focused on learning the very basics of Haskell. There are "TODOs " where the mentee is expected to work on.


### Requirements

An installation of stack is needed. Further reference on: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/

### Installation

After cloning this repository, and finishing the `TODO: ` marks the mentee should run the following:
```sh
$ stack setup
$ stack install
$ stack build --profile
$ stack exec -- m3-exe +RTS -p

```
In order to run the project and analyze the profiler output that will be written to the m3-exe.prof at this folder level.
Please include a file called `analysis` where the mentee explains the results.

### Work

The mentee is expected to fill the `TODO: ` marks accordingly to the function. and analyze them. The analysis should be in the `analysis` file
